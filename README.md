Maternal Mortality: Global Perspectives and Australia & Using Machine Learning to Predict Future Outcome

The objective is to see how maternal mortality rates trend globally and potential influencing factors in Australia

we hope to create a dashboard that allows user see patterns between maternal mortality rates and potential influencing factors eg health insurance, location or if there are other factors.

what factors contribute to the disparity between MMR in different countries
Can we identify enough relevant features to predict MMR for the next ten years?
For our Machine Learning predictions we wanted to answer the following questions:
